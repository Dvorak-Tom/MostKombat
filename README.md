# Gameplay Overview
Players select their avatars and get into the fighting arena. During each turn, they can decide to either Charge their attack or go straight for the Attack. Charging might end up in a miss, causing the turn to be wasted.

Life-bars represent each player's health. Reduce your opponent's health to 0 to emerge victorious.
